The Data Access Library (DAL) - README
======================================

The DAL provides data access to radio astronomy data in HDF5 format produced by the LOFAR telescope.
It ships with the specifications describing the data formats and provides a reference implementation to access all data fields with long-term version compatibility in mind. DAL is written in C++ and offers Python bindings to all functionality.
