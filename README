Requirements:
        - cmake 2.8+
        - swig
        - python-dev
        - numpy
        - libhdf5-*-dev
        - libhdf5-*
Optional:
        - doxygen (for documentation and python docstring support)

To build:
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD -DPYTHON_DEST=$PWD/python && make install

Regarding the location of the HDF5 libs that will be used, FindHDF5 as included in CMake says the following:
# To provide the module with a hint about where to find your HDF5 installation,
# you can set the environment variable HDF5_ROOT.  The Find module will then
# look in this path when searching for HDF5 executables, paths, and libraries.


**** use LUS environment ***
        When 'use LUS' is active, add -DHDF5_C_INCLUDE_DIR=$LOFARSOFT/release/include/hdf5 to cmake
        to avoid confusion with the HDF5 installed in /usr.

To test:
        export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PWD/python
        cd ../examples
        python example-bf-read.py
        python example-custom-write.py

To regenerate the docstrings and doxygen documentation, you need to install doxygen, and run
        make clean
        make docstrings.i
