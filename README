Data Access Library (DAL) - README
==================================

The DAL provides data access to radio astronomy data produced by the LOFAR
telescope. It is a reference implementation to access all HDF5 data fields
with long-term version compatibility in mind. DAL is written in C++ and offers
Python bindings for all its functionality. It also comes with API documentation,
a user manual, and a test suite.

Source code is available at https://github.com/nextgen-astrodata/DAL

Documentation is available at http://nextgen-astrodata.github.com/DAL

Documents that specify supported data formats are available at
