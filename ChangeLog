Data Access Library (DAL) - ChangeLog
=====================================

2.5.0 (initial DAL v2 release)
- Improved support for beamformed (BF) and transient buffer board (TBB) data formats. First "release" version.
- Improved SWIG Python bindings in functionality, type mapping (custom STL vector binding), usability (doc strings, tab completion), and error handling.
- Added per-attribute/group/dataset versioning for backward-compatibility and other versioning checks.
- Added 3D data set support and simpler functions for 1D data sets.
- Extended support for HDF5 custom tuple types beyond complex value types to Coordinate and Range types.
- Improved file open/create functionality with explicit open/close functions, safe "default" object state, basic file content checks, and auto-created attributes.
- Added "global" per-file info and made it available to all HDF5 objects in the file without the need to "navigate" the HDF5 object hierarchy.
- Added flagging support for TBB.
- Added exception hierarchy.
- Added utilities for BF and TBB header printing, BF header editing, and TBB empty/flagged data scanning.
- Added eight C++ and Python example programs (bf introspection, bf read, bf recreate dataset, bf custom write, exceptions, bf/tbb introspection, tbb read, tuple types).
- Added two BF and two TBB example HDF5 files with some data.
- Added test suite. All utilities and examples are also run as test cases, some using the example HDF5 files. All 37 tests should pass.
- Extensive documentation: User manual (Sphinx), API reference (Doxygen), README, INSTALL, Contributing, KnownIssues, ChangeLog, and a requirements/design decisions document.
- Made user manual and API reference available online at http://nextgen-astrodata.github.com/DAL.
- Improved compatibility with various Linux and Mac OS environments and compilers.
- Improved naming of DAL library and utilities to liblofardal.so.x.y.z and lofar_[tbb,bf]_progname.py to clarify and avoid clashes (libdal).
- Added an uninstaller; also removes .pyc bytecode files.
- Fixed many usability issues and bugs.
- Added license text and headers.
- Initial attempt at distribution package generation.
