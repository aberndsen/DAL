The Data Access Library (DAL) - CONTRIBUTING
============================================

External contributions in any form (comments, requests, issue reports, patches, ...) are welcome.
To keep a maintainable code base and not drift away from the goals of DAL, we may or may not decide to include the changes as provided.

_NOTE_: By contributing to this project you certify that you have the right to submit the contribution under the open source license covering this project, and that you understand that a record of this contribution with any personal information provided along may be redistributed with this project.


Contributing
------------

- Send patches by mail or enclosed in the issue report (plain text and inline, not attached), or with a pull request. For more information on sending pull requests, see http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/
- Please notify us well before you are done (read: begin) developing a significant feature, so we can cooperate towards smooth inclusion and avoid needless (double or unmergeable) work.
- Split large changes into multiple small patches where each patch makes one _logical_ change.


Contribution Policy
-------------------

When receiving feature requests or other contributions to include, we consider the following:
- The contribution must be in line with the purpose of DAL, that is data access for LOFAR (for now) data products.
- The contribution must be useful for enough users to warrant inclusion in a common library.
- The contribution must not slow down frequently executed functionality.
- The request must be realistic given the man power resources we have for DAL, both to implement and to maintain.
