Data Access Library (DAL) - KnownIssues
=======================================

KI 1: No support for Python 3
Description: The build system does not support Python 3, whether 2 and 3 are installed or only 3.
  This used to work after it was fixed in LDA, even if 2 and 3 were both installed, but is now unsupported again. 
  Note that the LOFAR software does not support Python 3 either.
Workaround: Use Python 2.6 or 2.7.
Status: Low. This will not be worked on for 2.0.0.

KI 2: No support for Windows
Description: We do not build/run under Windows.
Workaround: None (use Linux or MacOS).
Status: Won't fix. Radio astronomers don't use Windows.
