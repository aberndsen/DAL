Data Access Library (DAL) - KnownIssues
=======================================

KI 1: No support for Python 3
Description: The build system does not support Python 3, whether 2 and 3 are installed or only 3.
  This used to work after it was fixed in LDA, even if 2 and 3 were both installed, but is now unsupported again. 
  Note that the LOFAR software does not support Python 3 either.
Workaround: Use Python 2.6 or 2.7.
Status: Low. This will not be worked on for 2.0.0.

KI 2: 'make uninstall' leaves empty installation directories behind
Description: The uninstall script removes all installed files. It also removes runtime generated .pyc files.
  It does not remove created directories, even if empty.
  These are: $PREFIX/share/doc/dal $PREFIX/include/dal $PYTHON_PREFIX/dist-packages/DAL and subdirectories.
  Parent directories may also have been created and not removed.
Workaround: Remove them by hand.
Status: Low. Already spent time to remove .pyc files. This will not be worked on further for 2.0.0.

KI 3: No support for Windows
Description: We do not build/run under Windows.
Workaround: None (use Linux or MacOS).
Status: Won't fix. Radio astronomers don't use Windows.

KI 4: Long build time of Python bindings (DALPYTHON_wrap.cxx)
Description: Compiling DALPYTHON_wrap.cxx can take a while, but on older GCC versions (e.g. 4.2.1) with the default
  build type ('RelWithDebInfo') it can take many minutes. Note that if you do a parallel build, it may appear to
  "hang" on another file, but building DALPYTHON_wrap.cxx is just not done yet.
Workaround: Build in Debug mode (without optimizations) by passing '-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug' to cmake, or
  upgrade your GCC version, or try to build with clang/llvm (last time we checked, 3.0 worked, 2.0 did not).
  If you don't need Python bindings, turn them off by passing '-DPYTHON_BINDINGS=OFF' to cmake.
Status: Won't fix. We don't know how to reduce SWIG's output, nor do we want to build in Debug mode by default.
