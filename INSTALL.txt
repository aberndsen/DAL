The Data Access Library (DAL) - Installation Instructions
=========================================================

The DAL repository contains some pregenerated files to reduce build dependencies for most users.


Retrieving DAL
--------------

To grab a copy of the DAL repository into a (new) directory 'DAL', run:

	git clone https://github.com/nextgen-astrodata/DAL.git DAL


Build Instructions
------------------

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD -DPYTHON_DEST=$PWD/python && make && make test && make install

Regarding the location of the HDF5 libs that will be used, FindHDF5 as included in CMake says the following:
# To provide the module with a hint about where to find your HDF5 installation,
# you can set the environment variable HDF5_ROOT.  The Find module will then
# look in this path when searching for HDF5 executables, paths, and libraries.

Additional CMake Variables
--------------------------

The following custom flags can be added to the cmake command line:

        -DGENERATE_DOCS=OFF             Do not generate documentation.
        -DPYTHON_BINDINGS=OFF           Do not generate Python bindings.
        -DQUIET_HDF5_ERRORS=OFF         Do not override the HDF5 error handler (exceptions will still be
                                        thrown, but the default HDF5 handler will also print the full error
                                        stack on stderr).


Dependencies
------------

To use a pre-compiled DAL:
	- libhdf5-1.8 or later
	- python	(version 2.3+ or 3; if running Python applications)
	- python-numpy	(idem)

	- casacore	(optional, for higher level functionality)

To build, additionally:
	- cmake 2.8+
	- make
	- g++ or llvm with clang
	- libhdf5-dev-1.8+
	- python-dev

Maintainer and developer builds, additionally:
	- git
	- casacore
	- swig 1.3+	(regenerate Python bindings)
	- doxygen 1.6+	(regenerate documentation and python docstring support)
	- pdflatex	(regenerate user manual, data product specification, and design documentation)
	- valgrind	(run test suite tracking memory related bugs)
